### Tags

Like Medium, Stack Overflow, and many other programming resources, microservices can have tags that points to specific subject matter within the developer ecosystem. They can be anything from a technology, to a library. Naetorp tags are also highly coupled with points, and so instead of total points per user, there is total points per tag per user, and point ranks per tag.
